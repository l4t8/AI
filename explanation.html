    <p class ="question2">How do they work?</p>
    <p id ="bigtext">This AIs(Artificial intelligence) have neurons each one with a value or more,
        that evolve another group of neurons which will either evolve into another or
        give the output. With each generation of "creatures" some neurons will get more
        weight than others and the starting values which lead to a succesful output will
        be replicated, introducing small mutations in each generation of creatures to reach
        the point when they AI is finished and able to perform its task.
